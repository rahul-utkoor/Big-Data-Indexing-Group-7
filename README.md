# Big-Data-Indexing-Group-7

1) We are generating LibGIST executable file which is there in build folder and using it to compute gist descritor.
2) gist_feature_collection.py file is used to convert images to gist descriptors as 960-dimensional vector.
3) oph.py consists of actual working code which needs to be completed.
4) We are using peekaboom dataset which consists of ~58000 images.

# Execution steps
The source folder consists of seven java files, we have to execute OPH.java by passing command line arguments 'm' and 'path to the dataset'. Where m corresponds to bit size.
